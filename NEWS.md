# radiant.multivariate 1.6.7

* Fixed labeling bug in mds function

# radiant.multivariate 1.6.0

* Using "Radiant for R" in UI to differentiate from "Radiant for Python"
* Addressed a package documentation issue due to a change in roxygen2

# radiant.multivariate 1.5.0.0

* Improvements to screenshot feature. Navigation bar is omitted and the image is adjusted to the length of the UI.
* Line graphs treated more similarly to bar-graphs (i.e., can have a binary factor variable on the y-axis)
* Removed all references to `aes_string` which is being deprecated in ggplot soon
* Replaced reference to 'size' in favor of 'linewidth' due to changes in ggplot2
* Code styling

# radiant.multivariate 1.4.4.0

* Added option to create screenshots of settings on a page. Approach is inspired by the snapper package by @yonicd

# radiant.multivariate 1.4.1.0

* Fixed `is_empty` function clash with `rlang`
* Adjustments to work with the latest version of `shiny` and `bootstrap4`

# radiant.multivariate 1.3.6.0

* Allowing singular correlation matrix in `pre_factor`

# radiant.multivariate 1.3.5.0

* Minor adjustments in anticipation of dplyr 1.0.0

# radiant.multivariate 1.3.2.0

* Allow factor variables in K-clustering using clustMixType::kproto

# radiant.multivariate 1.3.0.0

* Allow factor variables in pre-factor, factor, and attribute based maps. Correlations will be calculated `polycor::hetcor` and factor scores are calculated using `psych::score.irt.poly`.
* Add option to save cluster membership for hierarchical clustering
* Add `gower` distance as a distance metric for hierarchical clustering
* Use `patchwork` for grouping multiple plots together
* Update action buttons that initiate model estimation when one or more inputs are changed. When a model should be re-estimated, a spinning "refresh" icon will be shown

# radiant.multivariate 1.1.1.0

* Documentation updates (i.e., key functions for each tool)
* Numerous small code changes to support enhanced auto-completion, tooltips, and annotations in shinyAce 0.4.1

# radiant.multivariate 0.9.9.2

* Label numbers for stored factor scores from factor analysis will now always correspond to the numbers used in the summary output
* Fix for kmeans bar-plot after dplyr 0.8.1 release
* Add information on R-squared when storing PW and IW tables for conjoint analysis with individual level data
* Added option to (not) standardize data for K-clustering or Hierarchical clustering. 

# radiant.multivariate 0.9.9.0

* Create bi-plots in _Multivariate > Factor_
* Fixes to accommodate breaking changes in dplyr 0.8.0

# radiant.multivariate 0.9.8.0

* Ensure variable and dataset names are valid for R (i.e., no spaces or symbols), "fixing" the input as needed
* Fix initial plot size for `kclus` in the browser interface
* Fix labels in `pre_factor` after a ggplot2 update
* Avoid a warning in the `pre_factor` Plot tab on refresh
* Option to pass additional arguments to `shiny::runApp` when starting radiant such as the port to use. For example, radiant.multivariate::radiant.multivariate("https://github.com/radiant-rstats/docs/raw/gh-pages/examples/demo-dvd-rnd.state.rda", port = 8080) 
* Avoid generatign `pred_data = ""` for conjoint predictions
* Load a state file on startup by providing a (relative) file path or a url

# radiant.multivariate 0.9.7.0

## Major changes

* Using [`shinyFiles`](https://github.com/thomasp85/shinyFiles) to provide convenient access to data located on a server

## Minor changes

* Option to add selected labels to the dendogram in hierarchical clustering
* Replace non-ASCII characters in example datasets
* Remove `rstudioapi` as a direct import
* Revert from `svg` to `png` for plots in `_Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_. `svg` scatter plots with many point get to big for practical use on servers that have to transfer images to a local browser
* Removed dependency on `methods` package

# radiant.multivariate 0.9.5.0

* Fix to accomodate changes in `deparse` in R 3.5

# radiant.multivariate 0.9.3.1

## Major changes

* Various changes to the code to accomodate the use of `shiny::makeReactiveBinding`. The advantage is that the code generated for _Report > Rmd_ and _Report > R_ will no longer have to use `r_data` to store and access data. This means that code generated and used in the Radiant browser interface will be directly usable without the browser interface as well.
* Used `ggplot2` and `ggrepel` for `mds` brand maps
* Used `ggplot2` and `ggrepel` for `prmap` brand maps

## Deprecated

* `pmap` was renamed to `prmap` to avoid conflict with `purrr::pmap`

# radiant.multivariate 0.9.2.0

## Major changes

* Renamed `pmap` function for perceptual maps to `prmap` to avoid conflict with `purrr::pmap`
* `Estimate` buttons indicate when models should be re-estimated based on changes in user input
* Upload and download data using the Rstudio file browser. Allows using relative paths to files (e.g., data or images inside an Rstudio project)
* Long lines of code generated for _Report > Rmd_ or _Report > R_ will be wrapped to enhance readability 

## Minor changes

* Enhanced keyboard shortcuts
* Upgraded tidyr dependency to 0.7

## Bug fixes

* Fix for `pmap` and `mds` when a tibble is passed  

# radiant.multivariate 0.8.7.1
